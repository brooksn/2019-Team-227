## Open San Diego + Friends

Welcome to the Team page for the [BigDataForSanDiego 2019](https://bigdataforsandiego.github.io) team "Open San Diego + Friends", a collaboration between [Open San Diego](https://opensandiego.org) brigade volunteers and SDSU students.

Our theme and forthcoming hack will be:

> Using data analysis to determine and characterize transit needs for the elderly and mobility impaired

> Then communicating the availability of needs of transit to the affected population and policy makers

Our first step will be to put together a map to help us understand how the aging population is currently distributed in San Diego, in relation to transportation infrastructure.

The target will be to display this data [on an interactive map](data.html).
